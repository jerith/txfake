txfake
======

I often find myself wanting to test the interactions between various things in
Twisted, but connecting them over a real network (even localhost) poses an
assortment of annoying problems.

`txfake` avoids these problems by providing a fake network connection for such
tests.

TODO:
 * Write some docs.
